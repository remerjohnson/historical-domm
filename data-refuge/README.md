# Data Refuge Workflow

**Warning: very early stages!**

Workflow is generally based on the [DataRefuge project](https://github.com/datarefugephilly/workflow). Heavily modified to match UC San Diego processes and tools.  

## Identification of Datasets

Triage will occur to identify the datasets at greatest risk of loss, also taking into account the general importance of the data to the community.

## Data Acquisition / Temporary Deposit

Researchers will sign up for and/or provide an ORCID along with their data and, if possible, metadata.  

## Metadata Wrangling and Data Packaging

`data_refuge_template.csv` is the template to use for the basic description for each package. This is the minimum level of description.    

Note: If package will also be ingested into the DAMS, fill out the [latest standard input template](https://github.com/remerjohnson/domm-metadata/blob/master/xls_standard_input_template.xlsx) as well, and keep it outside of the data package zip.  

## Ingest into DAMS or Long-Term Deposit

Ingest into DAMS will follow normal DAMS ingest procedures.  

Ingest into long-term storage solutions will depend on the target solution. Once we have a clearer picture of which options we will use, we can determine that piece of the ingest workflow.
