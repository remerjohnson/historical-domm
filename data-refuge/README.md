`data_refuge_template.csv` is the template to use for the basic description for each package.  

Note: If package will also be ingested into the DAMS, fill out the [latest standard input template](https://github.com/remerjohnson/domm-metadata/blob/master/xls_standard_input_template.xlsx) as well, and keep it outside of the data package zip.
