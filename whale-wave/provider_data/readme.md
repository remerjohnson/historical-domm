Public Data Collection for "Whale Wave" publication by Keen et al. 
(accepted in 2016 at _Marine Ecology Progress Series_)
Metadata and public data collection were prepared by lead author Eric Keen, [ekeen@ucsd.edu](ekeen@ucsd.edu)

-----

This data collection has two main folders:   

* `2015`: for the 2015 dataset used to build habitat models.  
*  `decade`: for the decade-long dataset (2005 - 2014) used to identify and test the statistical significance of the "whale wave".  

In each folder you will find PDF documents that detail the data processing and analysis used in their respective topics. These PDFs guide the user through the location and content of the data and R scripts within the subfolders. 

\*** Note that there are some references to data and functions that are not provided within this collection. Those references correspond to raw or original data that were formatted and streamlined into the final datasets provided in this collection. It was impractical to provide all versions of the data here. Be assured that all data needed to reproduce the final results of our paper are provided here.

2015 folder:  

- The PDF explaining the Habitat Modeling is found in `2015 > Habitat Model > HabitatModel.pdf`. This PDF was compiled using the R/LateX software known as Sweave. The Sweave file is also included in this folder: `2015 > Habitat Model > HabitatModel.RnW`.

Decade folder:  

- The PDF explaining how the data were prepared for analysis is found in `decade > data > Decade-DataPrep.PDF` (with corresponding .RnW file).
- The PDF explaining how the Randomization routine was done is found in `decade > randomization > Randomization.PDF` (with corresponding .RnW file).
- The PDF explaining how the results were calculated and displayed is found in `decade > Decade-Results.PDF` (with corresponding .RnW).
