# Intro
-------
This is a repository to test how our normal workflow would look like in git and GitHub.  

A proposed general workflow is:  
+ Master branch is where all the edits happen: so add the Excel template, rename it, edit it some, etc.  
+ Add the original metadata as its own branch that we most likely don't touch.  
+ After initial template is added, we could then analyze the original in OpenRefine (and add commit message about that / any relevant files).  
+ We then make our changes to our template sheet in master branch and commits / pushes as needed.   
+ If someone else would like to download or edit the metadata, they would go through the normal GitHub process of clone or fork, make changes, submit pull request.  \
+ Even after the files are deleted on staging, the metadata repository could remain updated and preserved.
